üß† NautilusTrader Integration Plan for Polygon Prediction Market App

Overview

This document outlines a phased plan to integrate NautilusTrader into a Python-based backend for a Polymarket (Polygon) prediction market trading app. The focus is on enabling manual outcome buying with advanced position management features such as max bid, sell price, and stop loss.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 1: Manual Buy + Position Creation

Frontend UI: Place Bet
	‚Ä¢	Form Inputs:
	‚Ä¢	Market
	‚Ä¢	Outcome
	‚Ä¢	Max Bid Price (required)
	‚Ä¢	Sell Price (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Stop Loss Price (optional)
	‚Ä¢	Action:
	‚Ä¢	Submit POST request to /positions/

Backend API: POST /positions/
	‚Ä¢	Creates a new position with:
	‚Ä¢	market_id, outcome_id
	‚Ä¢	max_bid_price
	‚Ä¢	sell_price
	‚Ä¢	stop_loss_price
	‚Ä¢	status = "open"
	‚Ä¢	entry_price = null (until filled)
	‚Ä¢	Initiates trade:
	‚Ä¢	Uses NautilusTrader logic to:
	‚Ä¢	Place a limit buy at max_bid_price
	‚Ä¢	On success, updates entry_price, filled_at, volume

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 2: Position Model

SQLAlchemy or Pydantic Position Model

class Position(Base):
    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True)
    market_id = Column(String)
    outcome_id = Column(String)
    entry_price = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    max_bid_price = Column(Float)
    sell_price = Column(Float)
    stop_loss_price = Column(Float)
    filled_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    status = Column(Enum("open", "closed", "cancelled"))
    created_at = Column(DateTime)
    updated_at = Column(DateTime)


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 3: Live Price Monitoring Service

Background Worker or Microservice
	‚Ä¢	Polls live prices every 15‚Äì60 seconds for markets with open positions
	‚Ä¢	For each position:
	‚Ä¢	If price ‚â§ stop loss ‚Üí auto sell
	‚Ä¢	If price ‚â• sell target ‚Üí auto sell
	‚Ä¢	On sell:
	‚Ä¢	Update status = closed
	‚Ä¢	Log exit_price, exit_time, was_auto = True

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 4: View + Manual Cashout

API Endpoints
	‚Ä¢	GET /positions/ ‚Äî List all positions
	‚Ä¢	POST /positions/{id}/sell ‚Äî Manually close position and sell

Frontend Table: Open Positions
	‚Ä¢	Display:
	‚Ä¢	Entry Price
	‚Ä¢	Current Price
	‚Ä¢	PnL Estimate
	‚Ä¢	Sell Button for Manual Cashout

‚∏ª

üîÆ Optional Future Features
	‚Ä¢	Trailing stop loss
	‚Ä¢	Partial position sells
	‚Ä¢	PnL and price history charting
	‚Ä¢	Alerts/notifications when stop-loss or sell targets are reached

‚ùì Questions to Address
	1.	How are live prices currently ingested‚Äîvia the Polymarket orderbook API?
	2.	Are trades already executable via a wallet, or do you need wallet support too?
	3.	Should this support future automated trading logic (e.g. based on signals or news)?
